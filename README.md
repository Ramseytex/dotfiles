# dotfiles
dotfiles for zsh, tmux, and vim

These are some of the files that I use to configure my terminal setup. 
1. I recommend using iTERM2 (https://iterm2.com) as it will greatly improve your experience with the more visual aspects of terminal (Themes, colors, etc.)
2. Once you've installed iTerm2 then the startup_scripts file is the next step.
3. Each of the dotfiles included in this repo are configured for my machine. You will need to change things like default user and or paths associated with your machine.
